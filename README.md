# SkyTemple Jam Patches
A collection of ARM Assembly patches I made for various submissions featured in SkyTemple ROM Hack Game Jams! Please be aware that each hack's folder WILL contain spoilers for each hack, so view at your own risk!
Please note that a bunch of this code may be unoptimized or just suck in general, given the usual time restrictions of the jam and my core inability to read.
All patches were designed with the NA/US version in mind and likely do/will not have EU or JP support.
